üìä NLP Sentiment Analysis Project ‚Äì College Work

I'm excited to share a recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) project I worked on as part of my college studies. The goal was to build a sentiment analysis system to classify user reviews as positive or negative.

üîç Here's what we did:

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized and analyzed the distribution of sentiments

Feature Engineering: Applied Bag of Words and TF-IDF techniques

Modeling: Trained and evaluated several ML models using performance metrics and visual plots

Optimization: Used Grid Search and PCA with top-performing models

Deployment: Saved the best model and built a pipeline to process and classify new reviews in real time

This project was a valuable experience in applying core NLP and Machine Learning techniques to solve a real-world problem.
